    <section class="computer-vision-basics">
      <h2>Understanding Computer Vision</h2>
      <p>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with the ability of computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos.</p>

      <h3>Key Components of Computer Vision</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>**Image Acquisition:** Capturing images and videos from various sources, such as cameras, sensors, and drones.</li>
        <li>**Image Preprocessing:** Enhancing and preparing images for further analysis, such as noise reduction and contrast adjustment.</li>
        <li>**Feature Extraction:** Identifying and extracting relevant features from images, such as edges, shapes, and patterns.</li>
        <li>**Image Classification:** Categorizing images based on their content, such as recognizing objects, scenes, and activities.</li>
        <li>**Object Detection:** Locating and identifying specific objects within images or videos.</li>
        <li>**Image Segmentation:** Dividing images into meaningful segments or regions, such as separating foreground from background.</li>
        <li>**Image Tracking:** Monitoring the movement of objects over time in videos or sequences of images.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="computer-vision-applications">
      <h2>Computer Vision Revolutionizing Fields</h2>
