    <section class="nlp-basics">
      <h2>Understanding Natural Language Processing</h2>
      <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP algorithms enable machines to process, analyze, and understand natural language text and speech, enabling a wide range of applications.</p>

      <h3>Key Components of Natural Language Processing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>**Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Extracting meaning and intent from natural language input.</li>
        <li>**Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Generating human-like text from structured data.</li>
        <li>**Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.</li>
        <li>**Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language into text.</li>
        <li>**Text Summarization:** Condensing lengthy text into a concise summary.</li>
        <li>**Sentiment Analysis:** Identifying and classifying opinions and emotions expressed in text.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="nlp-applications">
      <h2>Natural Language Processing Revolutionizing Industries</h2>
      <p>Natural language processing is transforming various industries, from healthcare to education, customer service, and beyond. Here are a few examples:</p>

      <ul>
