    <h1>Computer Vision</h1><br><br>
    <p><h2>What is computer vision?</h2>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.
    If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start.
  Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.
<br><br><h2>Computer Vision Applications</h2>There is a lot of research being done towards the computer vision field, but it's not just research. Real-world applications demonstrate how important computer vision is to endeavours in business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life.
A key driver for the growth of these applications is the flood of visual information flowing from smartphones, security systems, traffic cameras and other visually instrumented devices.
This data could play a major role in operations across industries, but today goes unused. The information creates a test bed to train computer vision applications and a launchpad for them to become part of a range of human activities.
<br><br><strong style="font-size: large;">IBM-</strong>This company uses computer vision to create things like My Moments for the 2018 Masters golf tournament. IBM's Watson watched hundreds of hours of Masters footage and could identify the sights and the sounds of significant shots. It curated these key moments and delivered them to fans as personalized highlight reels.
<br><br><strong>Google Translate-</strong>Google lets the users point a smartphone camera at a sign in another language or a note with another language and almost immediately obtain a translation of the sign or note in their preferred language.
<br><br><strong>Self-Driving vehicles-</strong> This relies on computer vision to make sense of the visual input from a car's cameras and other sensors. It's essential to identify other cars, traffic signs, lane markers, pedestrians, bicycles and all of the other visual information encountered on the road.
<br><br><strong>Facial Recognition and Authentication-</strong> Companies like Apple,Facebook and more use computer vision to allow a better way to enhance different security measures this allows certain apps and phones to be unlocked by facial recognition allowing for a more powerful way of safety for their users.
